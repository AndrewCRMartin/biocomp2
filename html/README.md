Biocomputing II / html
======================

This directory contains only the HTML file for the initial view of the
database.

There would be an `html2` directory if there is an alternative front end.

In this example, it has been implemented as a Python script so it can
access the configuration information - running this script generates
the HTML (this is done by the install script).
