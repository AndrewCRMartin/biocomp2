Biocomputing II / cgi-biocomp2/cgi
==================================

This directory contains the code for the CGI scripts.

Note that I have given the CGI scripts an extension of .cgi rather than
.py, but they are still python programs!

It imports the `blapi.py` module from the `../bl` directory.

There would be a `cgi2` directory if there is an alternative front end.
